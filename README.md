# svelte accessors demo

Proof of concept of using accessors to get and set data on a Svelte component. https://svelte-accessors-cmpbzhrlcp.now.sh. Created in response to [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43101214/use-getters-setters-in-svelte-custom-methods).


## Building

Clone this repo, then `npm install` and `npm run dev`. This will build the app and serve it at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

All the magic is in src/wrap.js.
